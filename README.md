# Face Recognition System

## Description

This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV, Python, dlib, and Haarcascade classifier. The system is capable of training models to recognize faces and using them to detect faces in images or video streams. Upon successfully detecting a face, the system triggers a beep to alert the user, indicating successful face detection. This project combines computer vision techniques with machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate and efficient face recognition capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- OpenCV
- Python
- dlib
- Haarcascade classifier

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/face-recognition.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Train the face recognition models using the provided datasets.
2. Run the main script `face_recognition.py` to detect faces in images or video streams.
3. Upon successful face detection, the system will trigger a beep to alert the user.
